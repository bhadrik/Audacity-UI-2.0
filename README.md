=========================


This project is intended to create UI library for wxWidgets application to make it look better.

Specificaly I am targeting Audacity.

In this project I'll create Audacity UI to make it look bit friendly and visualy likeable. First I will work on dark them and then may be on light also. I will design and also integrate it into Audacity.

This UI is inspired by Blender 3d UI and other good looking UIs.

UI prototype is designed in Figma, check it out [**here**](https://www.figma.com/proto/Zl4VzHsBkKzrYqkgyVV4Jv/Audacity-UI-2.0?node-id=2%3A5&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=2%3A5&hide-ui=1).
